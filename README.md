The Better McDonald's Mod was created by [moritz_htk](https://github.com/moritz-htk). Many well-known products have been added such as:
- Big Mac
- Happy Meal
- Coca-Cola

...and more! To prepare the food, a new cooking utensil and new ingredients were added. You can find salt blocks in rivers and extract salt from them. Seeds for tomato and lettuce plants are obtained from grass or fern.
